    "Monte Carlo and Temporal Difference Learning are two different strategies on how to train our value function. On one hand, Monte Carlo uses an entire episode of experience before learning. On the other hand, Temporal Difference uses only a step to learn.<br>\n",

    "Temporal Difference, on the other hand, waits for only one step $S_{t+1}$ to form a TD target and update $V(S_{t})$ using the TD target.\n",
    "\n",
    "The idea with TD is to update $V(S_{t})$ at each step. But because we didn’t experience an entire episode, we don’t have $G_{t}$. Instead, we estimate $G_{t}$ by adding $R_{t+1}$ and the discounted value of the next state.\n",
