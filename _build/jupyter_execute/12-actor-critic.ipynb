    "## The Problem of Variance in Reinforce\n",
    "\n",
    "In Reinforce, we want to increase the probability of actions in a trajectory proportionally to how high the return is.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](images/actor1.jpeg)\n",
    "\n",
    "This return $R(\\tau)$ is calculated using a Monte-Carlo sampling. We collect a trajectory and calculate the discounted return, and use this score to increase or decrease the probability of every action taken in that trajectory.\n",
    "\n",
    "The advantage of this method is that it’s unbiased. Since we’re not estimating the return, we use only the true return we obtain.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given the stochasticity of the environment and stochasticity of the policy, trajectories can lead to different returns, which can lead to high variance. Consequently, the same starting state can lead to very different returns. Because of this, the return starting at the same state can vary significantly across episodes.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](images/actor2.jpeg)\n",
    "\n",
    "The solution is to mitigate the variance by using a large number of trajectories. However, increasing the batch size significantly reduces sample efficiency. So we need to find additional mechanisms to reduce the variance."

    "To understand the Actor-Critic, imagine you’re playing a video game. You can play with a friend that will provide you with some feedback. You’re the Actor and your friend is the Critic.\n",

    "\n",
    "You don’t know how to play at the beginning, so you try some actions randomly. The Critic observes your action and provides feedback. Learning from this feedback, you’ll update your policy and be better at playing that game. On the other hand, your friend (Critic) will also update their way to provide feedback so it can be better next time.\n",

    "The idea is that the Advantage function calculates the relative advantage of an action compared to the others possible at a state: how taking that action at a state is better compared to the average value of the state.
