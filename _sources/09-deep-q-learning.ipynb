    "Consequently, we don’t have enough information about the best action to take at the beginning of the training. Therefore, taking the maximum Q-value (which is noisy) as the best action to take can lead to false positives. If non-optimal actions are regularly given a higher Q value than the optimal best action, the learning will be complicated.\n",
